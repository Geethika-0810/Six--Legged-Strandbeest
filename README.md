# Strandbeest Walking Mechanism 

Inspired by Theo Jansen's kinetic sculptures, this project features a six-legged Strandbeest walking mechanism designed using CAD. The goal was to simulate a wind-powered walking system using mechanical linkages and phase-offset motion for stability.

##  Overview
- Designed a single leg using Theo Jansen’s 13 “magic numbers”
- Replicated and assembled into six legs, grouped in three pairs
- Applied a 120° phase difference between each leg pair to maintain balance
- Fully constrained joints for lifelike motion simulation
- Partially built physical prototype for design validation

##  Tools Used
- SolidWorks (CAD Modeling & Assembly)

##  Objectives
- Create a stable, multi-legged walking mechanism powered by wind
- Understand real-world mechanical constraints in linkage systems
- Explore motion behavior with phase-offset mechanisms

##  Features
- Accurate leg geometry and movement based on Theo Jansen’s model
- Realistic simulation of gait cycle
- Independent leg configurations with balanced stride timing
- CAD-driven mechanical analysis and motion study
